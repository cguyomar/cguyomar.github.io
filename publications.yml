- abstract: Abstract Understanding microRNA (miRNA) functions has been
    hampered by major difficulties in identifying their biological
    target(s). Currently, the main limitation is the lack of a suitable
    strategy to identify biologically relevant targets among a high
    number of putative targets. Here we provide a proof of concept of
    successful de novo (i.e. without prior knowledge of its identity)
    miRNA phenotypic target (i.e. target whose de-repression contributes
    to the phenotypic outcomes) identification from RNA-seq data. Using
    the medaka mir-202 knock-out (KO) model in which inactivation leads
    to a major organism-level reproductive phenotype, including reduced
    egg production, we introduced novel criteria including limited
    fold-change in KO and low interindividual variability in gene
    expression to reduce the list of 2853 putative targets to a short
    list of 5. We selected tead3b, a member of the
    evolutionarily-conserved Hippo pathway, known to regulate ovarian
    functions, due to its remarkably strong and evolutionarily conserved
    binding affinity for miR-202-5p. Deleting the miR-202-5p binding
    site in the 3′ UTR of tead3b, but not of other Hippo pathway members
    sav1 and vgll4b, triggered a reduced egg production phenotype. This
    is one of the few successful examples of de novo functional
    assignment of a miRNA phenotypic target in vivo in vertebrates.

- abstract: Abstract Genome annotation plays a crucial role in providing
    comprehensive catalog of genes and transcripts for a particular
    species. As research projects generate new transcriptome data
    worldwide, integrating this information into existing annotations
    becomes essential. However, most bioinformatics pipelines are
    limited in their ability to effectively and consistently update
    annotations using new RNA-seq data. Here we introduce TAGADA, an
    RNA-seq pipeline for Transcripts And Genes Assembly, Deconvolution,
    and Analysis. Given a genomic sequence, a reference annotation and
    RNA-seq reads, TAGADA enhances existing gene models by generating an
    improved annotation. It also computes expression values for both the
    reference and novel annotation, identifies long non-coding
    transcripts (lncRNAs), and provides a comprehensive quality control
    report. Developed using Nextflow DSL2, TAGADA offers user-friendly
    functionalities and ensures reproducibility across different
    computing platforms through its containerized environment. In this
    study, we demonstrate the efficacy of TAGADA using RNA-seq data from
    the GENE-SWiTCH project alongside chicken and pig genome annotations
    as references. Results indicate that TAGADA can substantially
    increase the number of annotated transcripts by approximately
    \$300\\%\$ in these species. Furthermore, we illustrate how TAGADA
    can integrate Illumina NovaSeq short reads with PacBio Iso-Seq long
    reads, showcasing its versatility. TAGADA is available at
    github.com/FAANG/analysis-TAGADA.

- abstract: AbstractAUTS2 gene has been associated with numerous human
    pathologies including autism. The respective importance of its
    maternal and paternal contribution remains however unknown. Here we
    show using a vertebrate model that the lack of maternal, but not
    paternal, gene contribution triggers reduced embryonic survival and
    long-term macroscopic and behavioral differences, including reduced
    head size and reduced environment recognition abilities and anxiety.
    Maternal auts2 modulates maternally-inherited factors that control,
    in turn, early embryonic gene expression through transcriptional and
    post-transcriptional regulations, and ultimately regulate numerous
    transcription factors and evolutionarily conserved signaling
    pathways during neurodevelopment. We observed a significant
    enrichment in genes associated with human neuropathologies among
    genes that are under maternal auts2 control. We report that AUTS2
    belongs to a group of 45 evolutionarily-conserved
    maternally-expressed genes associated with behavior and
    neurodevelopment in vertebrates and linked to a diversity of human
    diseases. These results shed new light on intergenerational
    determinism of neurodevelopment and behavior in vertebrates,
    including in the context of human pathologies associated with AUTS2.

- abstract: SummaryPhosphorus cycling exerts significant influence upon
    soil fertility and productivity -- processes largely controlled by
    microbial activity. We adopted phenotypic and metagenomic approaches
    to investigate phosphatase genes within soils. Microbial communities
    in bare fallowed soil showed a marked capacity to utilise phytate
    for growth compared with arable or grassland soil communities. Bare
    fallowed soil contained lowest concentrations of orthophosphate.
    Analysis of metagenomes indicated phoA , phoD and phoX , and
    histidine acid and cysteine phytase genes were most abundant in
    grassland soil which contained the greatest amount of NaOH‐EDTA
    extractable orthophosphate. Beta‐propeller phytase genes were most
    abundant in bare fallowed soil. Phylogenetic analysis of metagenome
    sequences indicated the phenotypic shift observed in the capacity to
    mineralise phytate in bare fallow soil was accompanied by an
    increase in phoD , phoX and beta‐propeller phytase genes coding for
    exoenzymes. However, there was a remarkable degree of genetic
    similarity across the soils despite the differences in land‐use.
    Predicted extracellular ecotypes were distributed across a greater
    range of soil structure than predicted intracellular ecotypes,
    suggesting that microbial communities subject to the dual stresses
    of low nutrient availability and reduced access to organic material
    in bare fallowed soils rely upon the action of exoenzymes.
