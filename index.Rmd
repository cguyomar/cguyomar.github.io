## About me

<br>
I am a bioinformatician, with a background in statistics and agronomy.

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher in the bioinformatics unit of [iDiv](https://www.idiv.de/) in Leipzig, Germany.

I was a PhD student in [GenScale team](https://team.inria.fr/genscale/) (INRIA/IRISA) and [EGI team](https://www6.rennes.inra.fr/igepp/Equipes-de-recherche/Ecologie-et-Genetique-des-Insectes) (INRA Igepp) in Rennes, France.

Two projects of my PhD :

* Strain level characterization of the pea aphid symbionts by analysis of SNP profiles ([paper in Microbiome](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-018-0562-9s))
* Developpment of a method for reference guided assembly in metagenomic context ([in development](https://github.com/GATB/MindTheGap))
