            Understanding microRNA (miRNA) functions has been hampered by major difficulties in identifying their biological target(s). Currently, the main limitation is the lack of a suitable strategy to identify biologically relevant targets among a high number of putative targets. Here we provide a proof of concept of successful de novo (i.e. without prior knowledge of its identity) miRNA phenotypic target (i.e. target whose de-repression contributes to the phenotypic outcomes) identification from RNA-seq data. Using the medaka mir-202 knock-out (KO) model in which inactivation leads to a major organism-level reproductive phenotype, including reduced egg production, we introduced novel criteria including limited fold-change in KO and low interindividual variability in gene expression to reduce the list of 2853 putative targets to a short list of 5. We selected tead3b, a member of the evolutionarily-conserved Hippo pathway, known to regulate ovarian functions, due to its remarkably strong and evolutionarily conserved binding affinity for miR-202-5p. Deleting the miR-202-5p binding site in the 3′ UTR of tead3b, but not of other Hippo pathway members sav1 and vgll4b, triggered a reduced egg production phenotype. This is one of the few successful examples of de novo functional assignment of a miRNA phenotypic target in vivo in vertebrates.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Genome annotation plays a crucial role in providing comprehensive catalog of genes and transcripts for a particular species. As research projects generate new transcriptome data worldwide, integrating this information into existing annotations becomes essential. However, most bioinformatics pipelines are limited in their ability to effectively and consistently update annotations using new RNA-seq data. Here we introduce TAGADA, an RNA-seq pipeline for Transcripts And Genes Assembly, Deconvolution, and Analysis. Given a genomic sequence, a reference annotation and RNA-seq reads, TAGADA enhances existing gene models by generating an improved annotation. It also computes expression values for both the reference and novel annotation, identifies long non-coding transcripts (lncRNAs), and provides a comprehensive quality control report. Developed using Nextflow DSL2, TAGADA offers user-friendly functionalities and ensures reproducibility across different computing platforms through its containerized environment. In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of TAGADA using RNA-seq data from the GENE-SWiTCH project alongside chicken and pig genome annotations as references. Results indicate that TAGADA can substantially increase the number of annotated transcripts by approximately \$300{\textbackslash}\%\$ in these species. Furthermore, we illustrate how TAGADA can integrate Illumina NovaSeq short reads with PacBio Iso-Seq long reads, showcasing its versatility. TAGADA is available at github.com/FAANG/analysis-TAGADA.},

            AUTS2
            gene has been associated with numerous human pathologies including autism. The respective importance of its maternal and paternal contribution remains however unknown. Here we show using a vertebrate model that the lack of maternal, but not paternal, gene contribution triggers reduced embryonic survival and long-term macroscopic and behavioral differences, including reduced head size and reduced environment recognition abilities and anxiety. Maternal
            auts2
            modulates maternally-inherited factors that control, in turn, early embryonic gene expression through transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations, and ultimately regulate numerous transcription factors and evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways during neurodevelopment. We observed a significant enrichment in genes associated with human neuropathologies among genes that are under maternal
            auts2
            control. We report that
            AUTS2
            belongs to a group of 45 evolutionarily-conserved maternally-expressed genes associated with behavior and neurodevelopment in vertebrates and linked to a diversity of human diseases. These results shed new light on intergenerational determinism of neurodevelopment and behavior in vertebrates, including in the context of human pathologies associated with AUTS2.},

	abstract = {Summary
            
              Phosphorus cycling exerts significant influence upon soil fertility and productivity – processes largely controlled by microbial activity. We adopted phenotypic and metagenomic approaches to investigate phosphatase genes within soils. Microbial communities in bare fallowed soil showed a marked capacity to utilise phytate for growth compared with arable or grassland soil communities. Bare fallowed soil contained lowest concentrations of orthophosphate. Analysis of metagenomes indicated
              phoA
              ,
              phoD
              and
              phoX
              , and histidine acid and cysteine phytase genes were most abundant in grassland soil which contained the greatest amount of NaOH‐EDTA extractable orthophosphate. Beta‐propeller phytase genes were most abundant in bare fallowed soil. Phylogenetic analysis of metagenome sequences indicated the phenotypic shift observed in the capacity to mineralise phytate in bare fallow soil was accompanied by an increase in
              phoD
              ,
              phoX
              and beta‐propeller phytase genes coding for exoenzymes. However, there was a remarkable degree of genetic similarity across the soils despite the differences in land‐use. Predicted extracellular ecotypes were distributed across a greater range of soil structure than predicted intracellular ecotypes, suggesting that microbial communities subject to the dual stresses of low nutrient availability and reduced access to organic material in bare fallowed soils rely upon the action of exoenzymes.},
